# NOTE: We are abusing a race condition here to get the some initial bash
# commands related to environmental variables set. The postCreateCommand is run
# and then the container is connected to, meaning that we have a small amount of
# time where this script is run and no editor terminal is created. We use this
# time to set custom container messages and set up a local copy of Rust.
